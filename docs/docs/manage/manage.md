# Manage your Site

AEM provides the power and flexibility to build any type of site you would like. This guide on Managing your Site will help you understand how to implement [Assets](/manage/assets), [Site Elements](/manage/site-elements) (Headers/Footers), [Authoring](/manage/authoring), [Creating](/manage/create-page) and [Publishing](/manage/publish) a Page. To get into more advanced topics, continue aftewards to the Customize guide.
