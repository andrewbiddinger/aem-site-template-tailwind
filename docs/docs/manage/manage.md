# Manage your Site

AEM provides the power and flexibility to build any type of site you would like. This guide to Managing your Site will help you understand how to implement [Assets](/manage/assets), [Site Elements](/manage/site-elements) (Headers/Footers), [Authoring](/manage/authoring), [Creating](/manage/create-page) and [Publishing](/manage/publish) a Page. To learn more on advanced topics like CSS and template changes, continue on to the Customize guide.

While this guide is written for someone using the Site Template for the first time, feel free to jump around to the content that you need most. Otherwise, let's begin by discussing Assets!
