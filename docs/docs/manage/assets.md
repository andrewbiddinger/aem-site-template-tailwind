# Assets

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets is a digital asset management tool on AEM Platform that allows users to create, manage, and share their digital assets (images, videos, documents, and audio clips) in a web-based repository.

There is far more to AEM Assets than can be explained here, so make sure you follow up with Adobe Experience League [tutorials and documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/assets/overview.html?lang=en).

## Add your Logo

After you've created your Site, the first thing you will want to do is to upload your logo, and any images you know you want to use.

In your AEM Cloud Service environment, navigate to the home screen, and select Assets > Files, and then the folder with the name of your site.

> By default, the Tailwind AEM Site Template ships with minimal images for easy customization.

Once in your Site Assets folder, click on the **Create** button, and select **Files**. Navigate to your logo files - and any other images you want to use - on your computer and select them for upload. This will take a moment, depending upon the speed of your internet connection.

## Next Steps

Now that we've added your logo to the Site Assets, let's make use of it by updating the Site Elements Header & Footer.
