# Assets

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets is a digital asset management tool on the AEM Platform that allows users to create, manage, and share their digital assets (images, videos, documents, and audio clips) in a web-based repository.

There's lots more to AEM Assets than can be explained here, so make sure to follow up with Adobe Experience League [tutorials and documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/assets/overview.html?lang=en).

## Add your Logo

After you've created your site, the first thing you'll want to do is to upload your logo and any other images you might want to use.

In your AEM Cloud Service environment, navigate to the home screen, and select Assets > Files. Then select the folder with your site name.

> By default, the Tailwind AEM Site Template ships with a small set of placeholder images for easy customization.

Once in your Site Assets folder, click on the **Create** button and select **Files**. Navigate to your logo files - and any other images you want to use - on your computer and select them for upload. This will take a moment, depending on the speed of your internet connection.

## Next Steps

Now that we've added your logo to the Site Assets, let's make use of it by updating the Site Elements Header & Footer.
