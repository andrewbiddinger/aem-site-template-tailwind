# Publishing

Publishing your Site for the first time will take a few simple steps. Let's start by navigating to the root of your Site and selecting the checkbox for your Demo site. This will bring up the context menu at the top of the page. Select **Manage Publication**.

The next screen will ask if you want to preview or publish, as well as if you'd like to publish now or later. Choose publish and now, then click **Next**.

The next screen we'll configure to publish the entire site at once. Click on the **Include Children Settings** button which will bring up a modal. Click to **Include children** and deselect all the other options. Click **OK**.

This is our first publish, so we want to publish _everything_. On subsequent publishing, you might want to be more specific about what you're publishing.

Next, select the checkbox of the Demo site to bring up the **Published References** button and click it. This will provide a list of all the references connected with the site. Leave everything selected, and click **Done**. Then click **Publish**.

AEM Cloud Service will begin publishing your site, which may take a moment, depending upon environment performance and caching.

## Experience Fragments

We also need to publish Experience Fragments - i.e. Site Elements - separately. So let's navigate to the Experience Fragments. Click on the folder for your Demo site, and the checkbox to bring up the context menu. Select **Publish**.

## You're live!

Your site has now been published. Navigate to the en > Home page, and click Edit. Then once in edit mode, we can edit the URL to see your site. Change author to publish and remove /editor.html and you can see the live published version of your site. For example: http://author-p5128372-e8923745.adobeaemcloud.com/editor.html/content/demo/en/home.html becomes http://publish.p5128372-e8923745.adobeaemcloud.com/conteent/demo/en/home.html.

## Congratulations!

You've now learned the basics for how you can manage your new Site with AEM and the Tailwind AEM Site Template!
