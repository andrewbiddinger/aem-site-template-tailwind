# Style System

As a best practice, all Style System variations should be in their own file. Additionally, it is recommended to follow the BEM syntax when naming classes for use with the Style System. This must be coordinated with the classnames entered into the Style System within AEM, or the Style System classnames must be managed in code. For instance, you will find several variations for the teaser component that follow the BEM model in the Wireframe theme:

```
.teaser--text-bottom
.teaser--text-left
.teaser--text-right
.teaser--dark
```
