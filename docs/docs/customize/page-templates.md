# Page Templates

Page Templates are foundational to building your website. Without Page Templates, you can't have pages, and without Pages, you don't have a Site.

The Tailwind AEM Site Template comes with 6 Page Templates for you to choose from. You can also create your own Page Templates as you need.

## What you'll need

In order to create or edit Page Templates, you must have the Template Author permissions. Speak with your AEM System Administrator to grant you access.

## Getting Started

Page Templates can be found in the AEM Tools. To get there, in your AEM Cloud Environment, click on the AEM Logo and then click on the Tools hammer icon. In the General group, you will find Templates. Next click on the folder with the name of your Site. This will up a list of the Page Templates available on your Site.
