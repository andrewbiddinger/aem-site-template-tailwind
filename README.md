# Site Template Tailwind

This template is an opinionated version of the [Adobe standard site template for AEM](https://github.com/adobe/aem-site-template-standard). It is implemented with the best modern tools and libraries that enable rapid development and ensure code conformity. It comes with a Wireframe demo theme, which is styled separately from the theme files for easy removal. This template can serve as a standard starting point for creating a new site, or as a starting point for creating custom site templates.

## Quick Start 

* Go to <https://github.com/ez-aem/aem-site-template-tailwind/releases/latest> and download `aem-site-template-tailwind-{version}.zip`
* Upload `aem-site-template-tailwind-{version}.zip` in AEMaaCS's site creation wizard to create a new site from that template.
